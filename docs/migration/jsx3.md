## Migrate your code to JSX3 using a script

Instead of using
[reason-react official upgrade path](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/docs/en/jsx.html#migrating-from-version-2-to-version-3),
that allow you to use jsx2 & jsx3 at the same time, which is nice but require an
effort from you to make components written in one version to work with the other
& vice-versa, we will follow an
[alternative upgrade path](https://bloodyowl.github.io/blog/2019-04-19-an-alternative-migration-path-for-reason-react/)
based on a
[reason react compat hook](https://github.com/bloodyowl/reason-react-compat)
coupled with our compatibility layer `bs-react-native-jsx3-compat`

So first,

- Install `reason-react-native@^0.60.0` via yarn or npm,
- Replace `bs-react-native` with `bs-react-native-jsx3-compat` (`^0.11.1`) in
  your `package.json`,
- be sure that you use `bs-platform@^5.0.1`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è be sure to use
  `"reason-react": "https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react.git#835b90c"`
  (until 0.7.1 or 0.8 is out),
- use `react@^16.8.0`,
- add `reason-react-compat@^0.4.0`,
- (if needed, upgrade some deps (eg: `reason-apollo@^0.16.0`)),
- use https://github.com/bloodyowl/upgrade-reason-react-esy

---

### Workaround for git usage

_If you use released packages, you can skip these steps._

- `yarn add https://github.com/reason-react-native/reason-react-native.git`
- run a dirty command to get proper setup when using
  `bs-react-native-jsx3-compat`: add as a `prepare` script
  - `"prepare": "ln -sFf ../node_modules/reason-react-native-monorepo/reason-react-native/ ./node_modules",`
- run `yarn prepare` (this will be run each time you use yarn & will ensure that
  the trick is always around until you actually use released versions of this
  work)

---

Now you can try to compile your code but it's unecessarry. **You might have tons
of error because `bs-react-native` is full of jsx2** & we just migrated codebase
to jsx3.

So please:

- Ensure your project is full jsx3 (`bsconfig.json`:
  `"reason": {"react-jsx": 3},`)
- Replace `bs-react-native` by `bs-react-native-jsx3-compat` in your
  `bsconfig.json` (or `reason-react-native-monorepo/bs-react-native-jsx3-compat`
  for git users, check the
  [git monorepo trick](https://github.com/reason-react-native/reason-react-native#-usage-from-git-repo)
  if necessary)

üéâ **Compilation time!**

You should still have some errors, but probably not that much.

## Time to fix remaining errors before everything works‚Ñ¢

We did our best here to avoid you having to update/fix your code but there might
still be some minor stuff to adjust

- check `children` errors and remove
  `let children = React.Children.toArray(children);` that might have beed added
  without being necessary
- you can safely remove spread `...` for `children`
- you might need to tweak place where children are optional with
  `{children->Belt.Option.getWithDefault(React.null)}`

### Notes about `ReasonReact.wrapJsForReason` & `ReasonReact.wrapReasonForJs`

With reason-react 0.7 & new api, JavaScript code produced is just normal React
code. So this things are not necessary anymore but are not handled by the script
we used.

So you might need to remove those things & replace them with vanilla React code

- Remove `ReasonReact.wrapJsForReason`
  ([example](https://github.com/MoOx/moox.io/commit/1c38aa5bb583ff8146fc7e8fea06446d8447249a#diff-2ed4f80b953266403fd687c51270ebfa))
- Remove `ReasonReact.wrapReasonForJs`
  ([example](https://github.com/MoOx/moox.io/commit/1c38aa5bb583ff8146fc7e8fea06446d8447249a#diff-fe8d8d6fb5aac7a6cb2657ff9de22d89L65),
  [another example](https://github.com/MoOx/moox.io/commit/1c38aa5bb583ff8146fc7e8fea06446d8447249a#diff-cad3bf1049ec571062e3ad1e8c8857aaL72)
  )

## Compilation time

When you don't have any errors, just compile & enjoy jsx3. You can even add
`reason-react-native` to your `bsconfig.json` `bs-dependencies` & use it right
away with
[awesome hooks](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/docs/en/components) !

## But I have more time! I WANT MORE

You can do some easy stuff to cleanup your codebase now that everything is
working and that you are ready to use reason-react 0.7:

### Easy replacement

- `ReasonReact.string` => `React.string`
- `ReasonReact.array` => `React.array`
- `ReasonReact.null` => `React.null`
- `ReasonReact.reactElement` => `React.element`
- ...

### More tricky ones

You can probably remove lot of unecessary wrapping for stateless component that
don't use the lifecycle

```reason
  ReactCompat.useRecordApi({
      ...component,
      render: _self => {
```

Can be replaced with

```reason
({{

```

And

```reason
  ReactCompat.useRecordApi({
      ...component,
      render: _self =>
```

Can be replaced with

```reason
({
```

At this point, the 2 replacements above have generated syntax error, so you
should try to replace

```reason
,
  });
```

with

```reason
});

```

You should also be able to drop some
`let component = ReasonReact.statelessComponent...` too, since some won't be
used anymore thanks to the last removal step we did.

Now rely on refmt to get a cleaner code and you are good to go!
